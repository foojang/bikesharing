*8NYC to Des Moines Bike sharing**

The below data is to help Kate pitch the idea of a bike sharing program in Des Moines. We will be using data from NYCâ€™s Citi bikes bike sharing program. We will present our finding using Tableau and seven data points that will help show that this program can be successful outside of NYC 
Our first data point we can use is the trip duration. In NYC the most common trip length is 5 minutes. This can be useful in other cities where public transportation is not a common as NYC. Short trips will solve the last mile problem that stops people from taking advantage of public transit that does not take you point to point.
