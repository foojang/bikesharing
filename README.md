**NYC to Des Moines Bike sharing**

The below data is to help Kate pitch the idea of a bike sharing program in Des Moines. We will be using data from NYCâ€™s Citi bikes bike sharing program. We will present our finding using Tableau and seven data points that will help show that this program can be successful outside of NYC 

Our first data point we can use is the trip duration. In NYC the most common trip length is 5 minutes. This can be useful in other cities where public transportation is not a common as NYC. Short trips will solve the last mile problem that stops people from taking advantage of public transit that does not take you point to point.

For our campaign we should focus on men and getting them bought into the program and subscribers instead of one-off users.

The next graph shows the most active time is the beginning of the workday and the end of the workday.  This can be a great selling point for office workers to find more convenient parking away from the office and finish their commute on the bike.

Again men are the most common users and our advertising should first focus on men in Des Moines.

The most common users of the ride share program is subscribers. Sign up incentives can help new users make the transition to a daily user.

We also need to consider repair times and when bikes need to be down. The best for maintenance is after 2 am and before 6 am. This will reduce how many bikes are out of service during peak times.
